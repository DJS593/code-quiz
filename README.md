## Goal is develop an online quiz
- quiz is timed: 60 seconds
- user will be given 13 multiple choice questions randomly
- quiz is over when all questions are answered or times runs out
- user will be able to save score using their initials

### State of current prototype
- quiz contains random questions
- user is informed if question is correct or incorrect based on screen color
- A timer begins at 60, but quiz does not end when the timer hits 0. This enhancement will be added.
- Scoring is not operational, but will be added.  Method is discussed in scores.HTML, which is a secondary page that will be utilized for score delivery and tracking.
